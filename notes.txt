TODO (in order of priority):
* Finish Create Page Component w/ password validation and whatnot, be sure to add disable create button
* Fix the cramped view with the list of protected pages  
* Workout Page Decryption / encryption
* Research Ideal DB Model to ensure usability
* Create Model, Implement logic with trpc

Next Levels of Priority:
* Finalize theme
* Logo Creation
* Do we need any auth with the secret urls?


Carefully Design the models, we need to keep in mind the following:
* Limitations for a user since this is free
* Plan tracking
* Limits for # of pages and size of page

Down the line:
* theme options / prettify theme
* integrate with notion further?
* setup notion public integration
* Demo, Test, Iterate

Important:
* Ensure code is vulnerability free and that the db is secure
