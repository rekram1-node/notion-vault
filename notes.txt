TODO (in order of priority):

Enable Spend Management for all providers...

Next:
* add autosave to editor
* fix the lag issues that look kinda gross (specifically related to creation and deletion)
* Fix theme, adjust arrow colors
* Test creation and ensure all is functional...
* Look Into Notion stuff...

Next Levels of Priority:
* Finalize theme
* Logo Creation
* Do we need any auth with the secret urls?

Carefully Design the models, we need to keep in mind the following:
* Limitations for a user since this is free
* Plan tracking
* Limits for # of pages and size of page

Down the line:
* integrate with notion further?
* setup notion public integration
* Demo, Test, Iterate

Important:
* Ensure code is vulnerability free and that the db is secure
