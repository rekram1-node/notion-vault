MVP:
    Functionality needs:
        - update favicon
        - update theme to be prettier
        - create notion flow
        - speedy load times

    Guardrails:
        - spend management for providers?
        - cloudflare at the front door?
        - limitations:
            * # of pages
            * amount of page content
            * RateLimiting
            * password guess spam attacks?
            * max password length
            * max page name length
            * compress page content?

In order:
* Create full integration, new sign ups and sign ins should auto create encrypted docs
  - Ensure Webhook has permissions to do these things - test and iterate
  - needs to handle cases where insufficient permissions are given...
  - some easy way for a user to automatically add an encrypted snippet to their
    notion document from our UI
  - ...
* UX
  - once a page is initialized it should send you straight to editor rather than having to 
    re-enter password
  - cookies aren't being attached to requests when accessed through notion...
* 
* Prettify
  - Maybe - Adjust the top padding we see on the encrypted pages
* Preformance improvements
  - investigate any remaining areas with lag
* Add Guardrails
* Documentation, License, TOS, Privacy Policy, purchase domains, etc

Important:
* Need to make sure that code merges require permission of at least 1 other person at some point
* Wait till alpha is complete to do so^
