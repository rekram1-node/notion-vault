MVP:
    Functionality needs:
        - ensure editor works in all edge cases...
        - update favicon
        - update theme to be prettier
        - create notion flow
        - secret urls?

    Guardrails:
        - spend management for providers?
        - cloudflare at the front door?
        - limitations:
            * # of pages
            * amount of page content
            * RateLimiting
            * password guess spam attacks?
            * max password length
            * max page name length
            * compress page content?

Down the line:
* setup notion public integration

Important:
* Need to make sure that code merges require permission of at least 1 other person at some point
* Wait till alpha is complete to do so^
