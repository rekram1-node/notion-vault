TODO:
* create logo
* add encryption/decryption logic
* database?
* creating new secret urls
* Determine what would be on the settings page...

Carefully Design the models, we need to keep in mind the following:
* Limitations for a user since this is free
* Plan tracking
* Limits for # of pages and size of page

Down the line:
* theme options / prettify theme
* integrate with notion further?
* setup notion public integration
* Demo, Test, Iterate

Important:
* Ensure code is vulnerability free and that the db is secure
