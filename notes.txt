TODO (in order of priority):

Enable Spend Management for all providers...

Next:
* Add render page functionality
* Consistent Naming Pattern, probably easiest to opt for EncryptedDocument (name of the model)

After:
* get render page to work
* fix the lag issues that look kinda gross (specifically related to creation and deletion)

* Create TRPC endpoint to handle Document Creation. Should recieve
  Salt, Hashed Password, Encrypted Content, Salt used for content
  and lastly, the IV for the content
* Test creation and ensure all is functional...

* Page Decryption / encryption
* Research Ideal DB Model to ensure usability
* Create Model, Implement logic with trpc

Next Levels of Priority:
* Finalize theme
* Logo Creation
* Do we need any auth with the secret urls?


Carefully Design the models, we need to keep in mind the following:
* Limitations for a user since this is free
* Plan tracking
* Limits for # of pages and size of page

Down the line:
* integrate with notion further?
* setup notion public integration
* Demo, Test, Iterate

Important:
* Ensure code is vulnerability free and that the db is secure
